TwitterCrawler
==============

Simple crawler based on following a list (or two lists) of Twitter accounts.

See SimpleTwitterCrawler.java for main access point. 
NB: To run this, you will need to set up one (or more) Twitter OAuth accounts, and store the tokens/keys etc. in crawlA.xml (and optionally crawlB.xml). See [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/tokens-devtwittercom) for details.
